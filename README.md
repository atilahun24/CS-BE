Beep is a car review app written by you for you. All reviews are from actual customers not paid reviewers. Users can create a review for any car in the world and they can also check out reviews that other users have made.

front end repo: https://github.com/atilahun24/CS-FE

technologies used: Ruby on Rails

unsolved problems: none in the backend

planning, process, problem-solving: I initially was going to create a car
shopping app using a third party api, however, the link to the API Console for the api I was going to use was broken and there were no decent alternatives so I decided to change it to a car review site and seed the app myself.
